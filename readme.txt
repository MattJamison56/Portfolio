--Readme document for Matthew Jamison--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone elseâ€™s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

1. How many assignment points do you believe you completed (replace the *'s with your numbers)?
    I believe I earned full points on this assignment as I know I completed each of these categories and have done extra for this portfolio
    to be useful to me in the future.

2. What (a) basic features, (b) CSS features, and (c) advanced features did you include in your portfolio?

(a) Basic features
    I used multiple images across my website, links to separate pages like my GitHub and Linkedin, and appropriate headings/paragraph text.


(b) CSS features
    I used a lot of different CSS features including some experimental ones that didn't pass the CSS validation checks because they are new.
    I used bootstrap for my navigation bar as well as a custom font called Poppins that I got from Google fonts. I also modified every elements
    padding, margins, color, and more.


(c) Advanced features
    I used a navigation bar I got from bootstrap as well as a contact form that is linked to my email.


3. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?
    I spent around 25 hrs across 4 days creating this assignment including the preparation stages that I completed in Notion and Figma.


4. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs)
    https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/scroll-timeline
    I used this site to find out more about the experimental features scroll() and view() that I used to change the background color
    and move the "about text."
 

5. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?
    I didn't discuss or consult anyone for this assignment.


6. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
    I used node to run it locally for testing. Should be able to run the site with just "node server.js" I think. Also I had to re-add the original index.html and some others for it to push correctly. All my files should be in public though.
